# CP-Topics-Archieve


This repository is a collection of pattern-based Data Structures and Algorithms implementations.
For that, I have another repo: 

Codeforces: https://github.com/abirrahman26/Codeforces-Solutions

CodeChef: https://github.com/abirrahman26/Codechef-Solutions

The main focus is to understand algorithmic ideas rather than storing individual problem solutions.

Maintain reusable algorithm templates

Prepare for technical interviews


## 📂 Repository Style

Each topic folder contains:

Clean and optimized code templates

Short explanation comments inside code


## 🚀 Target Users
